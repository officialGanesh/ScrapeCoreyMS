How to Create a Network of Machines in VirtualBox with SSH Access,"July 20, 2017",Corey Schafer,"In this video, we’ll be learning how to clone Virtual Machines, add these machines to a network so they can communicate with each other, make sure they have internet access, and also set up SSH so that we are able to SSH into these machines from our host machine. This will allow us to pretty much build an entire virtual lab that we can use to test all kinds of different software. So after we’re done, this will give us the ability to quickly spin up a new VM that behaves just like a real machine on our network. Let’s get started.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7jD6nnYJy0
