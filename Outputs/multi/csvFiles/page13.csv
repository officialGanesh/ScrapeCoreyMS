Programming Terms: Mutable vs Immutable,"August 17, 2015",Corey Schafer,"In this programming terms video, we will be going over the difference between mutable and immutable objects. An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. This is in contrast to a mutable object, which can be modified after it is created. Let’s take a look at some examples as to what exactly this means and why it is important to know.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qQQ3yzbKp8

What advantage do namedtuples have over regular tuples and when should you use them? In this video, we’ll take a look at namedtuples and why you should use them.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfxJYp9_nJA
Programming Terms: Idempotence,"August 17, 2015",Corey Schafer,"In this programming terms video, we will be going over Idempotence. Idempotence is the property of certain operations in mathematics and computer science, that can be applied multiple times without changing the result beyond the initial application. Let’s take a look at this definition in-depth and go over a few examples.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaKZ4wKytcA
Programming Terms: String Interpolation,"August 17, 2015",Corey Schafer,"In this programming terms video, we will be going over string interpolation. String interpolation is the process of evaluating a string containing one or more placeholders and yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values.

Sublime Text Quick Tip: Launch Sublime Text from the Terminal,"May 14, 2015",Corey Schafer,"If you navigate from your terminal frequently, you have most likely run into the scenario where you are within a project directory and want to open a file or folder from that project. It is a pain to open up Finder, navigate to the project, and open the file or directory that way. Being able to open these projects and files from the terminal is much more convenient and saves a lot of time. In this video we’ll look at how we can do just that:",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wMKGs2fe4s
