Python Tutorial: File Objects – Reading and Writing to Files,"May 1, 2016",Corey Schafer,"In this Python Tutorial, we will be learning how to read and write to files. You will likely come into contact with file objects at some point while using Python, so knowing how to read and write from them is extremely important. We will learn how to read and write from simple text files, open multiple files at once, and also how to copy image binary files. Let’s get started.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh2ebFW8OYM
Python Tutorial: OS Module – Use Underlying Operating System Functionality,"April 8, 2016",Corey Schafer,"In this Python Tutorial, we will be going over the ‘os’ module. The os module allows us to access functionality of the underlying operating system. So we can perform tasks such as: navigate the file system, obtain file information, rename files, search directory trees, fetch environment variables, and many other operations. We will cover a lot of what the os module has to offer in this tutorial, so let’s get started.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJxcKyFMTGo
Python Tutorial: Decorators – Dynamically Alter The Functionality Of Your Functions,"April 8, 2016",Corey Schafer,"In this Python tutorial, we will be learning about decorators. Decorators are a way to dynamically alter the functionality of your functions. So for example, if you wanted to log information when a function is run, you could use a decorator to add this functionality without modifying the source code of your original function. So let’s take a look at how these decorators work and a few ways in which we can use them. Let’s get started.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsAPt_9Bf3U
"Python Tutorial: String Formatting – Advanced Operations for Dicts, Lists, Numbers, and Dates","April 8, 2016",Corey Schafer,"In this Python tutorial, we will be learning how to perform some advanced string formatting operations. Formatting our strings allows us to display our information in exactly the way we would like it to be displayed. Everyone, in almost all areas of Python programming, comes across a situation where they need to format a data type in a specific way. Let’s get started.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTX3IwquFkc
Programming Terms: Closures – How to Use Them and Why They Are Useful,"April 8, 2016",Corey Schafer,"In this programming terms video, we will be looking at the term “Closure”. We will learn what a closure is and why they are useful. We will look at examples in both Python and JavaScript. In Python, understanding closures helps us understand common language features like decorators. And in JavaScript, closures will allow us to better understand callback functions and much more. Let’s get started…",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swU3c34d2NQ
JavaScript Tutorial: Run JavaScript in Sublime Text with a NodeJS Build System,"April 8, 2016",Corey Schafer,"In this JavaScript Tutorial, we will be learning how to create a JavaScript build system within Sublime Text. This will allow us to run JavaScript code outside of a browser environment and write messages to the Sublime Text console. Let’s get started.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iPs43TppOY
Python Tutorial: Custom Sublime Text Build Systems,"April 8, 2016",Corey Schafer,"In this video we will be learning how to create multiple build systems within Sublime Text. This is useful if you have projects which require you to switch between Python 2 and Python 3, or if you’d like to customize your default Python build system. Let’s get started.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqcTfplzr7c
Programming Terms: First-Class Functions,"March 8, 2016",Corey Schafer,"In this programming terms video, we will be looking at the term “First-Class Function”. First-class functions are extremely important to grasp because understanding them will help us understand more complicated terms such as: Closures, Higher-order functions, currying, and more. We will be looking at examples of first-class functions in both Python and JavaScript so that we can really understand the concept, regardless of programming language. Let’s get started:",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kr0mpwqttM0
"Python Tutorial: Duck Typing and Asking Forgiveness, Not Permission (EAFP)","March 8, 2016",Corey Schafer,"In this Python Tutorial, we will look at a couple of the aspects of being “Pythonic”. If you’ve never heard the term Pythonic before, basically it means that you are following conventions and coding styles of the Python language in order to write clean and readable code.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3v9zMX1s4s
Customizing Your Terminal: How To Use and Modify Dotfiles,"February 5, 2016",Corey Schafer,"In this video, we will be tying together all of the information we learned in our previous two videos in order to explore and customize some pre-built dotfiles. Dotfiles can be extremely powerful and some people have put in a lot of effort to squeeze a lot of functionality into theirs. Luckily, the have open sourced these dotfiles for use to explore and learn. Let’s check out how we can use these files for ourselves:",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5RZWDLqifA
